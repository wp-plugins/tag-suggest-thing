Tag Suggest Thing uses the Yahoo! term extraction API to find tags to suggest.

== Description ==

Tag Suggest Thing adds a box to the sidebar, that when expanded, has a button that will send a request to the Yahoo! term extraction API to get a collection of (possibly) related terms.  Clicking the name of a term will add it as a tag; and there's also an option to add all of the terms.
